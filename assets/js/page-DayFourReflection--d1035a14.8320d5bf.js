This is the opportunity to create the basic design of a site before you begin to code. Wire-framing also allows clients to see a project before-hand, and make changes or discuss user functionality before it becomes more difficult to change things in the coding process. I would argue that wire-framing more complex and detailed designs is absolutely crucial in the design-phase, where if you have to change something down the road in the coding process, you could break other things in the process-- causing a cascading effect of frustration. Wire-framing at least gets those initial changes out of the way so a developer can stay on task.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=s.exports}}]);
